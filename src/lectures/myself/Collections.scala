import Array._
// Lists are immutable whereas arrays are mutable in Scala.
// Used to create back to front -> list.head always holds last inserted value
// Lists represents a linked list whereas arrays are flat
// List represents linked list in Scala
// if we need to create a list that is constantly changing, the preferred approach is to use a ListBuffer
// ListSet -> combination of both -> set implementation using list

// Arrays -> mutable
// Scala arrays can be generic. which mean we can have an Array[T], where T is a type parameter or abstract type.
// Scala arrays are compatible with Scala sequences â€“ we can pass an Array[T] where a Seq[T] is required.
// Scala arrays also support all sequence operations.

// To create a mutable, indexed sequence whose size can change ArrayBuffer class is used
// Tuple is a collection of elements. Tuples are heterogeneous data structures, i.e.,
// is they can store elements of different data types. A tuple is immutable, unlike an array in scala which is mutable

// In Scala, both mutable and immutable sets are available. Mutable set is those set in which
// the value of the object is change but, in the immutable set, the value of the object is not changed itself.

//    An iterator is a way to access elements of a collection one-by-one. It resembles to a collection
      //    in terms of syntax but works differently in terms of functionality. An iterator defined for
      //    any collection does not load the entire collection into the memory but loads elements one
      //    after the other. Therefore, iterators are useful when the data is too large for the memory
